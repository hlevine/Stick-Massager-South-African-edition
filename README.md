Stick-Massager-South-African-edition
====================================

The South African edition of the stick massager.   I have taken Youtube videos and have created the South African set of instructions to build one yourself.   I have included pictures, youtube video link and scanned copy of my shopping reciept to make it a walk in the park.  After the walk, use the massager.

All materials can be purchased at builder express or warehouse and Game.

The handle bar grips were purchased at Games fourways.    They cost around R36-00. They were not the cheapest but I like the colour. I measured them first before I bought the PVC pipe.  I knew pvc pipe came in 20 mm diametre range.

The 20 mm pvc pipe and 25 mm pipe couplers I Purchased at Builders Express.   Builders express is not as busy as Builders warehouse.  They don't have the range of builders warehouse but The shop is not as busy.   

Just a reminder.  Bring a hacksaw because unless you have a large car, the pvc pipe won't fit in the car.  You will need to cut it.

I cut my 20mm PVC pipe into an intial 450 mm length.  Once I Had fitted the connectors (8 of them) I trimmed my PVC down.   The connectors must have gaps between them.  Ie when the rotate lateral movement on the pipe is need to allow them to rotate.


I have posted a youtube video.

Special thanks go to dixieoutlaw4x4 for his youtube instructions.    His tutorial was easy to understand. Thank you.
